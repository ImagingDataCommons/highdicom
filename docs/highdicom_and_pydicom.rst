Highdicom and Pydicom
=====================

The ``highdicom`` library is built on top of ``pydicom``. This page summarizes
the relationship between the two.

Pydicom
-------

`pydicom`_ is a widely-used Python package for working with DICOM files in
Python. It uses a fundamental class, ``pydicom.Dataset``, to represent DICOM
objects within Python programs. It handles operations such as:

- Reading and writing ``Dataset`` objects to/from files.
- Accessing and setting individual attributes on ``Dataset`` objects.
- Decoding pixel data within DICOM files to NumPy arrays, and encoding pixel
  data from NumPy to raw bytes to store within ``Dataset`` objects.


Highdicom
---------

There is a wide variety of DICOM objects defined in the standard, covering many
types of images (X-Ray, CT, MRI, Microscopy, Ophthalmic images) as well as
various types of image-derived information, such as Structured Reports,
Annotations, Presentation States, Segmentations, and Parametric Maps. Formally,
these "types" are known as Information Object Definitions (IODs). The standard
requires different combinations of attributes are required for different IODs
(e.g. the "Echo Time" attribute exists with the *MRImage* IOD but not within
the *CTImage* IOD) ``pydicom`` represents all of these objects using a general
``Dataset`` class, which implements behavior that is common to all of these
objects. However, it does not attempt to specialize its representation to
implement specific behaviors of these various IODs, leaving it up to the user
to interpret the individual attributes in the file in each case.

The purpose of ``highdicom`` is to build upon ``pydicom`` to implement specific
behaviors for various IODs, to make it easier to correctly create and work with
**specific** types of DICOM object. ``highdicom`` defines sub-classes of
``pydicom.Dataset`` that implement particular IODs, for example:

- :class:`highdicom.Image` (this actually covers many IODs)
- :class:`highdicom.seg.Segmentation`
- :class:`highdicom.sr.EnhancedSR`
- :class:`highdicom.sr.ComprehensiveSR`
- :class:`highdicom.sr.Comprehensive3DSR`
- :class:`highdicom.pm.ParametricMap`
- :class:`highdicom.pr.GrayscaleSoftcopyPresentationState`
- :class:`highdicom.pr.PseudoColorSoftcopyPresentationState`
- :class:`highdicom.pr.AdvancedBlendingPresentationState`
- :class:`highdicom.ko.KeyObjectSelectionDocument`
- :class:`highdicom.ann.MicroscopyBulkSimpleAnnotations`
- :class:`highdicom.sc.SCImage`

Since each of these objects are sub-classes of ``pydicom.Dataset``, they all
inherit its behaviors for accessing and setting individual attributes and
writing to file. They should also be interoperable with ``pydicom.Dataset``,
such that they can be used anywhere a ``pydicom.Dataset`` is expected. However
they also have:

- A constructor that dramatically simplifies the creation of the objects while
  ensuring correctness. The constructors guide you through which attributes are
  required and enforce inter-relationships between them required by the
  standard.
- Several of these IODs also have further methods that allow you to search,
  filter, and access the information within them more easily.

However, not all classes within ``highdicom`` are DICOM objects, and such
objects are not sub-classes of ``pydicom.Dataset``. Notable examples include
:class:`highdicom.Volume`,
:class:`highdicom.spatial.ImageToReferenceTransformer` (and other similar
objects), :class:`highdicom.io.ImageFileReader`.
