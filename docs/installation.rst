Installation
------------

Pre-built package available at PyPi:

.. code-block:: none

    pip install highdicom

Or alternatively, through conda:

.. code-block:: none

    conda install conda-forge::highdicom

The library relies on the underlying ``pydicom`` package for decoding of pixel
data, which internally delegates the task to either the ``pillow`` or the
``pylibjpeg`` packages. Since ``pillow`` is a dependency of *highdicom* and
will automatically be installed, some transfer syntax can thus be readily
decoded and encoded (baseline JPEG, JPEG-2000, JPEG-LS). Support for additional
transfer syntaxes (e.g., lossless JPEG) requires installation of the
``pylibjpeg`` package as well as the ``pylibjpeg-libjpeg`` and
``pylibjpeg-openjpeg`` packages. Since ``pylibjpeg-libjpeg`` is licensed under
a copyleft GPL v3 license, it is not installed by default when you install
*highdicom*. To install the ``pylibjpeg`` packages along with *highdicom*, use

.. code-block:: none

    pip install 'highdicom[libjpeg]'

Install directly from source code (available on Github):

.. code-block:: none

    git clone https://github.com/imagingdatacommons/highdicom ~/highdicom
    pip install ~/highdicom
