# High DICOM

A library that provides high-level DICOM abstractions for the Python programming language to facilitate the creation and handling of DICOM objects for image-derived information, including image annotations and image analysis results.
It currently provides tools for creating and decoding the following DICOM information object definitions (IODs):
* Segmentation images
* Structured Reports
* Secondary Capture images
* Legacy Converted Enhanced CT/PET/MR images (e.g. for single frame to multi-frame conversion)

## Documentation

Please refer to the online documentation at [highdicom.readthedocs.io](https://highdicom.readthedocs.io), which includes installation instructions, a user guide with examples, a developer guide, and complete documentation of the application programming interface of the `highdicom` package.
