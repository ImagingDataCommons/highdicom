    Parameters
    ----------
    row_index: int
        One-based Row index value for a given frame (tile) along the column
        direction of the tiled Total Pixel Matrix, which is defined by
        the second triplet in `image_orientation` (values should be in the

    column_index: int
        One-based Column index value for a given frame (tile) along the row
        direction of the tiled Total Pixel Matrix, which is defined by
        the first triplet in `image_orientation` (values should be in the
        range [1, *n*], where *n* is the number of tiles per row)
    x_offset: float
        X offset of the Total Pixel Matrix in the slide coordinate system
        in millimeters
    y_offset: float
        Y offset of the Total Pixel Matrix in the slide coordinate system
        in millimeters
    rows: int
        Number of rows per Frame (tile)
    columns: int
        Number of columns per Frame (tile)
    image_orientation: Sequence[float]
        Cosines of the row direction (first triplet: horizontal, left to right,
        increasing Column index) and the column direction (second triplet:
        vertical, top to bottom, increasing Row index) direction for X, Y, and
        Z axis of the slide coordinate system defined by the Frame of Reference
    pixel_spacing: Sequence[float]
        Spacing between pixels in millimeter unit along the column direction
        (first value: spacing between rows, vertical, top to bottom,
        increasing Row index) and the row direction (second value: spacing
        between columns, horizontal, left to right, increasing Column index)
    slice_thickness: Union[float, None], optional
        This parameter is unused and passing anything other than None will
        cause a warning to be issued. Use spacing_between_slices to specify the
        spacing between neighboring slices. This parameter will be removed in a
        future version of the library.
    spacing_between_slices: Union[float, None], optional
        Distance between neighboring focal planes in micrometers
    slice_index: Union[int, None], optional
        Relative one-based index of the focal plane in the array of focal
        planes within the imaged volume from the slide to the coverslip
